## Importance and Context
The COVID-19 has changed everything, and one of the most important aspects is how the campaigns for the US 2020 elections were conducted. The pandemic forced to cancel conventions and prompted many states to change how people get and submit their ballots, with all the uncertainty it created. And to make things worse, all of this happened in the middle of social distancing restrictions not seen since almost a century. It's essential to understand how elected officials' approval changed when people got in close contact with COVID-19.

## Description of Data
The ANES data set contains information from 8,280 pre-election interviews with 
U.S. citizens of voting age. Two variables are particularly relevant for us 
to answer this question:

- `V201145`: `APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE R’S GOVERNOR HANDLING COVID-19`

- `V201624`: `ANYONE IN HOUSEHOLD TESTED POS FOR COVID-19`
